avant-gout de vue-test-utils, clonez notre répertoire de démonstration avec l'installation de base puis installez les dépendances :\ngit clone https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-getting-started\ncd vue-test-utils-getting-started\nnpm install\n\nVous allez voir que le projet possède un simple composant, counter.js :\n// counter.js\n\nexport default {\n  template: `\n    \n      {{ count }}\n      Increment\n    \n  `,\n\n  data () {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    increment () {\n      this.count++\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nMontages de composants\nvue-test-utils teste les composants Vue en les isolants puis en les montant, il simule les entrées nécessaires (props, injections et évènements utilisateur) et asserte les sorties (le rendu, les évènements émis).\nLes composants montés sont retournés dans un Wrapper, qui expose de nombreuses méthodes pour manipuler, traverser et interroger l'instance du composant Vue en question.\nVous pouvez créer des wrappers en utilisant la méthode mount. Créons un fichier nommé test.js :\n// test.js\n\n// Importe la méthode `mount()` depuis test utils\n// et le composant qu'on souhaite tester\nimport { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport Counter from './counter'\n\n// On monte le composant et nous voilà avec un wrapper\nconst wrapper = mount(Counter)\n\n// On accède à l'instance actuelle de Vue via `wrapper.vm`\nconst vm = wrapper.vm\n\n// Pour inspecter le wrapper en profondeur, utilisez console\n// puis votre aventure avec vue-test-utils commence !\nconsole.log(wrapper)\n\nTester le contenu du rendu HTML d'un composant\nNous avons maintenant un wrapper, la première chose que l'on peut faire, c'est de vérifier que le contenu du rendu HTML du composant correspond à celui attendu.\nimport { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport Counter from './counter'\n\ndescribe('Counter', () => {\n  // On monte le composant et nous voilà avec un wrapper\n  const wrapper = mount(Counter)\n\n  it('fait le rendu correctement', () => {\n    expect(wrapper.html()).toContain('0')\n  })\n\n  // c'est aussi très simple de vérifier qu'un élément existe\n  it('a un bouton', () => {\n    expect(wrapper.contains('button')).toBe(true)\n  })\n})\n\nOn peut maintenant lancer les tests avec  npm test. Vous devriez voir les tests se lancer et réussir.\nSimulation de l'interaction utilisateur\nNotre compteur devrait s'incrémenter quand l'utilisateur clique sur le bouton. Pour simuler ce comportement, on doit tout d'abord localiser le bouton avec wrapper.find(), qui retourne un wrapper pour l'élément bouton. On peut ensuite simuler un clic en appelant .trigger() sur le wrapper du bouton :\nit('le clic sur le bouton devrait incrémenter le compteur', () => {\n  expect(wrapper.vm.count).toBe(0)\n  const button = wrapper.find('button')\n  button.trigger('click')\n  expect(wrapper.vm.count).toBe(1)\n})\n\nEt quid de nextTick ?\nVue groupe les mises à jour du DOM en attentes puis les appliquent de façon asynchrone pour prévenir d'éventuels multiples rendus causés par de multiples mutations de données. C'est pourquoi en pratique, on a souvent à utiliser Vue.nextTick pour attendre que Vue modifie le DOM actuel après avoir lancé quelques changements d'état.\nPour simplifier cela, vue-test-utils applique toutes les mises à jour de façon synchrone afin que vous n'ayez pas besoin d'utiliser Vue.nextTick pour attendre des mises à jour du DOM dans vos tests.\nNote : nextTick est toujours nécessaire quand vous souhaitez explicitement faire avancer la boucle des évènements, pour des opérations telles que des fonctions de rappel ou des résolutions de promesses.\nSi vous avez toujours besoin de nextTick dans vos fichiers de tests, faites attention aux erreurs jetées aux erreurs lancées à l'intérieur qui peuvent ne pas être attrapées par votre lanceur de tests car il utilise des promesses. Il y a deux approches pour régler celà : vous pouvez affecter la fonction de rappel done du système de gestion d'erreurs globales de Vue au démarrage des tests, ou vous pouvez appeler nextTick sans argument pour l'utiliser sous forme de promesse :\n// ceci ne sera pas intercepté\nit(\"pas d'interception\", (done) => {\n  Vue.nextTick(() => {\n    expect(true).toBe(false)\n    done()\n  })\n})\n\n// les deux tests ci-dessous vont fonctionner comme souhaité\nit(\"attraper l'erreur avec `done`\", (done) => {\n  Vue.config.errorHandler = done\n  Vue.nextTick(() => {\n    expect(true).toBe(false)\n    done()\n  })\n})\n\nit(\"attraper l'erreur avec une promesse\", () => {\n  return Vue.nextTick()\n    .then(function () {\n      expect(true).toBe(false)\n    })\n})\n\nEt après ?\n\nIntégrez vue-test-utils dans votre projet en choisissant votre lanceur de tests\nEn apprendre plus sur les techniques et astuces pour écrire des tests\n\n"},"guides/common-tips.html":{"url":"guides/common-tips.html","title":"Astuces","keywords":"","body":"Astuces\nSavoir quoi tester\nPour les composants graphiques (UI), nous ne recommandons pas une couverture complète. En effet, cela mène à trop d'attention sur les détails de l'implémentation interne des composants et pourrait produire des tests instables.\nA contrario, nous recommandons d'écrire des tests qui vérifient le bon fonctionnement de l'interface public de vos composants et ainsi traiter le cœur de ceux-ci telle une boîte noire. Un simple test pourrait vérifier qu'une entrée utilisateur (due à une interaction ou un changement de props) passée au composant nous donnerait le résultat attendu (cela peut être un nouveau rendu ou l'envoi d'un évènement).\nPar exemple, pour le composant Counter, qui incrémente un compteur visible de 1 à chaque fois qu'un bouton est cliqué, le scénario de test devrait simuler le clic puis s'assurer que le rendu visuel a bien été incrémenté d'un aussi. Le test se fiche de savoir comment le compteur a incrémenté la valeur, il s'occupe seulement de l'entrée et de la sortie (du résultat).\nLe bénéfice de cette approche est que tant que l'interface public de votre composant reste la même, vos tests passeront et ce peu importe le comportement interne de votre composant, qui pourrait changer avec le temps.\nCe sujet est discuté plus en détails dans une très bonne présentation de Matt O'Connell.\nRendu superficiel\nDans des tests unitaires, on souhaite s'intéresser au composant qui est en train d'être testé comme une unité isolée et ainsi éviter de s'assurer du bon comportement des composants enfants.\nDe plus, pour les composants qui contiennent beaucoup de composants enfants, l'intégralité de l'arbre de rendu peut être énorme. Répétitivement rendre tous les composants pourrait réduire la vitesse de nos tests.\nvue-test-utils vous permets de monter un composant sans avoir à rendre ses composants enfants (en les ignorants) avec la méthode shallow :\nimport { shallow } from '@vue/test-utils'\n\nconst wrapper = shallow(Component) // retourne un wrapper contenant une instance de composant montée\nwrapper.vm // l'instance de Vue montée\n\nAssertion d'évènements émis\nChaque wrapper monté va automatiquement enregistrer les évènements émis par l'instance de Vue en question. Vous pouvez récupérer ces évènements en utilisant la méthode wrapper.emitted() :\nwrapper.vm.$emit('foo')\nwrapper.vm.$emit('foo', 123)\n\n/*\n`wrapper.emitted()` retourne l'objet suivant :\n{\n  foo: [[], [123]]\n}\n*/\n\nVous pouvez ensuite réaliser des assertions sur ces données :\n// asserte que l'évènement est bien émit\nexpect(wrapper.emitted().foo).toBeTruthy()\n\n// asserte la taille du compteur d'évènement\nexpect(wrapper.emitted().foo.length).toBe(2)\n\n// asserte le contenu lié à l'évènement\nexpect(wrapper.emitted().foo[1]).toEqual([123])\n\nVous pouvez aussi récupérer un tableau des évènements dans l'ordre d'émition en appelant wrapper.emittedByOrder().\nManipuler l'état d'un composant\nVous pouvez directement manipuler l'état d'un composant en utilisant la méthode setData ou setProps sur le wrapper :\nwrapper.setData({ count: 10 })\n\nwrapper.setProps({ foo: 'bar' })\n\nSimuler des props\nVous pouvez passer des props au composant en utilisant l'option propsData de Vue :\nimport { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'\n\nmount(Component, {\n  propsData: {\n    aProp: 'une valeur'\n  }\n})\n\nVous pouvez aussi mettre à jour les props d'un composant déjà monté avec la méthode wrapper.setProps({}).\nPour une liste complète des options, veuillez regarder la section sur les options de montage de la documentation.\nAppliquer des plugins globaux et des mixins\nDes composants pourraient se fier à des fonctionnalités injectées par un plugin global ou un mixin, par exemple vuex ou vue-router.\nSi vous écrivez des tests pour des composants dans une application spécifique, vous pouvez mettre en place les mêmes plugins globaux et mixins en une seule fois dans vos tests. Dans certains cas, comme tester un composant générique utilisé par des applications différentes, il est favorable de tester ces composants dans une installation plus isolée, sans avoir à polluer le constructeur global Vue. On peut utiliser la méthode createLocalVue pour faire cela :\nimport { createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils'\n\n// créer un constructeur local de `Vue`\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\n\n// installer des plugins comme d'habitude\nlocalVue.use(MyPlugin)\n\n// passe la `localVue` aux options de montage\nmount(Component, {\n  localVue\n})\n\nSimuler des injections\nUne stratégie alternative pour injecter des propriétés est de simplement les simuler. Vous pouvez faire cela avec l'option mocks :\nimport { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'\n\nconst $route = {\n  path: '/',\n  hash: '',\n  params: { id: '123' },\n  query: { q: 'bonjour' }\n}\n\nmount(Component, {\n  mocks: {\n    $route // ajoute l'objet `$route` simulé à l'instance de Vue avant de monter le composant\n  }\n})\n\nGérer le routage\nDepuis que le routage, par définition, porte sur la structure générale de l'application et implique plusieurs composants. Il est mieux testé via des tests d'intégration ou point à point (end-to-end). Pour des composants individuels qui se fie aux fonctionnalités de vue-router, vous pouvez les simuler en utilisant les techniques mentionnées plus haut.\n"},"guides/dom-events.html":{"url":"guides/dom-events.html","title":"Mouse, Key and other DOM Events","keywords":"","body":"Testing Key, Mouse and other DOM events\nTrigger events\nThe Wrapper expose a trigger method.

Après avoir soigneusement analysé et comparé les bibliothèques, il y a deux lanceurs de tests que nous recommandons :\n\nJest est le lanceur de test le plus complet en termes de fonctionnalités. Il requiert une configuration minimale, installe JSDOM par défaut, fournit des assertions prêtes à l'utilisation et a une très bonne interface en ligne de commandes. Cependant, vous allez avoir besoin d'un préprocesseur afin d'être capable d'importer les composants monofichiers dans vos tests. On a créé le préprocesseur vue-jest qui peut gérer les fonctionnalités communes des composants monofichiers. Il n'a cependant pas encore autant de fonctionnalités que vue-loader.\n\nmocha-webpack est une surcouche de webpack + Mocha avec une expérience simplifiée et un mode de surveillance. Les bénéfices de cette installation sont que l'on peut avoir le support complet des composants monofichiers via webpack + vue-loader. Il y a cependant plus de configurations à réaliser.\n\n\nEnvironnement du navigateur\nvue-test-utils se fie à un environnement de navigateur. Techniquement, vous pouvez le lancer dans un vrai navigateur, mais cela n'est pas recommandé dû à la complexité de lancer de réels navigateurs sur différentes plateformes. Au lieu de cela, nous recommandons de lancer les tests sous Node.js avec un environnement virtuel de navigateur en utilisant le JSDOM.\nLe lanceur de tests Jest installe automatiquement JSDOM. Pour d'autres lanceurs de tests, il faut le faire manuellement en utilisant jsdom-global dans la déclaration de vos tests :\nnpm install --save-dev jsdom jsdom-global\n\n\n// dans test setup / entry\nrequire('jsdom-global')()\n\nTester des composants monofichiers\nLes composants Vue monofichiers nécessitent une étape de précompilation avant qu'ils soient lancés dans Node.js ou sur un navigateur. Il existe deux méthodes recommandées pour réaliser la compilation : avec un préprocesseur Jest ou directement en utilisant webpack.\nLe préprocesseur vue-jest supporte les fonctionnalités basiques des composants monofichiers. Il ne gère pas actuellement les blocs de style et les blocs personnalisés, qui sont eux uniquement supportés par vue-loader. Si vous utilisez ces fonctionnalités ou d'autres configurations liées à webpack, vous aurez besoin d'utiliser l'installation basée sur webpack + vue-loader\nLisez les guides suivants pour différentes installations :\n\nTester des composants monofichiers avec Jest\nTester des composants monofichiers avec Mocha + webpack\n\nRessources\n\nComparaison de lanceurs de tests\nProjet exemple avec Jest\nProjet exemple avec Mocha\nProjet exemple avec tape\nProjet exemple avec AVA\n\n"},"guides/testing-SFCs-with-jest.html":{"url":"guides/testing-SFCs-with-jest.html","title":"Tester des composants monofichiers avec Jest","keywords":"","body":"Tester des composants monofichiers avec Jest\n\nUn exemple de projet pour cette installation est disponible sur GitHub.\n\nJest est un lanceur de tests développé par Facebook. Il a pour but de procurer une solution complète de tests unitaires. Vous pouvez en apprendre plus sur Jest sur sa documentation officielle.\nInstaller Jest\nOn va supposer que vous commencez avec une installation qui a déjà webpack, vue-loader et Babel correctement configurés (ex. le template webpack-simple via vue-cli).\nLa première chose à faire est d'installer Jest et vue-test-utils :\n$ npm install --save-dev jest vue-test-utils\n\nEnsuite, on doit définir un script dans notre package.json.\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"jest\"\n  }\n}\n\nTraiter les composants monofichiers dans Jest\nPour indiquer à Jest comment traiter les fichiers *.vue, on va avoir besoin d'installer et de configurer le préprocesseur vue-jest : \nnpm install --save-dev vue-jest\n\nEnsuite, créez un objet jest dans package.json :\n{\n  // ...\n  \"jest\": {\n    \"moduleFileExtensions\": [\n      \"js\",\n      \"json\",\n      // indique à Jest de gérer les fichiers `*.vue`\n      \"vue\"\n    ],\n    \"transform\": {\n      // traite les fichiers `*.vue` avec `vue-jest`\n      \".*\\\\.(vue)$\": \"/node_modules/vue-jest\"\n    },\n    \"mapCoverage\": true\n  }\n}\n\n\nNote : vue-jest ne supporte actuellement pas toutes les fonctionnalités de vue-loader, par exemple le support des blocs personnalisés et du chargement de styles. De plus, quelques fonctionnalités spécifiques à webpack comme la scission de code ne sont pas supportées. Pour les utiliser, lisez le guide sur tester des composants monofichiers avec Mocha et webpack.\n\nGérer les alias webpack\nSi vous utilisez un alias de résolution dans la configuration de webpack, c.-à-d. faire un alias @ pour /src, vous devez aussi ajouter une configuration pour Jest en utilisant l'option moduleNameMapper :\n{\n  // ...\n  \"jest\": {\n    // ...\n    // supporte la même concordonance d'alias @ -> src dans le code source\n    \"moduleNameMapper\": {\n      \"^@/(.*)$\": \"/src/$1\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nConfigurer Babel pour Jest\n\nMême si les dernières version de Node.js supportent la plupart des fonctionnalités ES2015, vous souhaitez quand même utiliser la syntaxe des modules ES ainsi que les fonctionnalités stage-x dans vos tests. Pour cela, on doit installer babel-jest :\nnpm install --save-dev babel-jest\n\nEnsuite, on doit indiquer à Jest de gérer les fichiers de tests JavaScript avec babel-jest en ajoutant une entrée sous jest.transform dans package.json :\n{\n  // ...\n  \"jest\": {\n    // ...\n    \"transform\": {\n      // ...\n      // gérer le JavaScript avec `babel-jest`\n      \"^.+\\\\.js$\": \"/node_modules/babel-jest\"\n    },\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n\nPar défaut, babel-jest va automatiquement s'autoconfigurer dès l'installation. Cependant, comme nous avons explicitement ajouté une transformation pour les fichiers *.vue, on se doit aussi d'explicitement configurer babel-jest.\n\nEn supposant que vous utilisez babel-preset-env avec webpack, la configuration par défaut de Babel désactive la transpilation des modules ES car webpack sait déjà comment traiter ces modules. Nous devons, cependant, l'activer pour nos tests car, Jest fonctionne directement dans Node.js.\nOn doit aussi indiquer à babel-preset-env d'utiliser la version de Node.js que nous utilisons. Cela empêchera de transpiler inutilement des fonctionnalités et lancera nos tests plus rapidement.\nPour appliquer ces options uniquement aux tests, mettez-les dans un fichier de configuration différent sous env.test (cela va être automatiquement être utilisé par babel-jest).\nExemple .babelrc:\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"env\", { \"modules\": false }]\n  ],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"presets\": [\n        [\"env\", { \"targets\": { \"node\": \"current\" }}]\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTest d'instantanés\nVous pouvez utiliser vue-server-renderer pour transformer un composant en une chaine de caractères afin de le sauvegarder dans un instantané pour Jest tests d'instantanés.\nLe résultat du rendu de vue-server-renderer inclut quelques attributs spécifiques au rendu côté serveur. Il ignore les espaces, cela rend plus dur d'analyser une différence. On peut améliorer l'instantané sauvegardé avec un sérialiseur personnalisé :\nnpm install --save-dev jest-serializer-vue\n\nPuis configurez-le dans package.json:\n{\n  // ...\n  \"jest\": {\n    // ...\n    // sérialiseur pour les instantanés\n    \"snapshotSerializers\": [\n      \"/node_modules/jest-serializer-vue\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nPlacer les fichiers de tests\nPar défaut, Jest va récursivement récupérer tous les fichiers qui ont une extension en .spec.js ou .test.js dans le projet. Si cela ne correspond pas à vos besoins, il est possible de changer l'expression régulière testRegex dans la configuration se trouvant dans package.json.\nJest recommande de créer un répertoire __tests__ au même niveau que le code testé, mais soyez libre de structurer vos tests selon vos besoins. Soyez juste au courant que Jest créera un répertoire __snapshots__ au même niveau que les fichiers de tests qui travaillent sur des instantanés.\nExemple d'une spécification\nSi vous êtes habitué à Jasmine, vous devriez très bien vous en sortir avec l'API d'assertions de Jest :\nimport { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport Component from './component'\n\ndescribe('Component', () => {\n  test('est une instance de Vue', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Component)\n    expect(wrapper.isVueInstance()).toBeTruthy()\n  })\n})\n\nRessources\n\nProjet exemple pour cette installation\nExemples et diapositives depuis la Vue Conf 2017\nJest\nBabel preset env\n\n"},"guides/testing-SFCs-with-mocha-webpack.html":{"url":"guides/testing-SFCs-with-mocha-webpack.html","title":"Tester des composants monofichiers avec Mocha et webpack","keywords":"","body":"Tester des composants monofichiers avec Mocha + webpack\n\nUn exemple de projet pour cette installation est disponible sur GitHub.\n\nUne des stratégies pour tester des composants monofichiers est de compiler tous nos tests via webpack puis de les passer dans un lanceur de tests. L'avantage de cette approche est qu'elle procure un support complet pour les fonctionnalités de webpack et de vue-loader, et ce, afin de ne pas réaliser de compromis dans notre code.\nTechniquement, vous pouvez utiliser n'importe quel lanceur de tests et relier le tout manuellement. Cependant, nous avons trouvé mocha-webpack qui procure une expérience très simplifiée pour cette tâche particulière.\nMettre en place mocha-webpack\nOn va supposer que vous commencez avec une installation qui a déjà webpack, vue-loader et Babel correctement configurés (cf. le template webpack-simple via vue-cli).\nLa première chose à faire est d'installer les dépendances de tests :\nnpm install --save-dev @vue/test-utils mocha mocha-webpack\n\nEnsuite, on doit définir un script test dans notre package.json.\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"mocha-webpack --webpack-config webpack.config.js --require test/setup.js test/**/*.spec.js\"\n  }\n}\n\nQuelques éléments importants à noter :\n\nLe paramètre --webpack-config indique le fichier de configuration webpack à utiliser pour les tests. Dans la plupart des cas, c'est identique à la configuration du projet actuel avec une petite modification. On en reparlera plus tard.\n\nLe paramètre --require permet de s'assurer que le fichier test/setup.js est bien exécuté avant les tests. Dans celui-ci, on met en place l'environnement où nos tests vont être exécutés.\n\nLe dernier paramètre est un glob pour indiquer les fichiers de tests à inclure dans le paquetage.\n\n\nConfiguration supplémentaire pour webpack\nExternaliser les dépendances npm\nDans nos tests, nous allons surement importer un nombre conséquent de dépendances npm, certaines d'entre elles n'ont pas été conçues pour une utilisation dans un navigateur et ne peuvent être empaquetées par webpack. Il faut aussi considérer qu'externaliser les dépendances augmente énormément la vitesse de lancement des tests. On peut externaliser toutes les dépendances npm avec webpack-node-externals :\n// webpack.config.js\nconst nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  externals: [nodeExternals()]\n}\n\nCoordinateur de sources\nLa coordinateur de sources (« Source maps ») doit être indiquée pour être utilisé par mocha-webpack. La configuration recommandée est la suivante :\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-cheap-module-source-map'\n}\n\nSi vous déboguez via votre IDE, il est recommandé d'ajouter la configuration suivante :\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  output: {\n    // ...\n    // utiliser des chemins absolus (c'est important si vous déboguez avec un IDE)\n    devtoolModuleFilenameTemplate: '[absolute-resource-path]',\n    devtoolFallbackModuleFilenameTemplate: '[absolute-resource-path]?[hash]'\n  }\n}\n\nMettre en place l'environnement du navigateur\nvue-test-utils requiert en environnement de navigateur pour fonctionner. On peut le simuler avec Node.js en utilisant jsdom-global :\nnpm install --save-dev jsdom jsdom-global\n\nPuis dans test/setup.js:\nrequire('jsdom-global')()\n\nCela ajoute un environnement de navigateur dans Node.js afin que vue-test-utils fonctionne correctement.\nChoisir une bibliothèque d'assertions\nChai est une bibliothèque populaire qui est généralement utilisée avec Mocha. Vous pouvez aussi jeter un coup d'œil à Sinon pour créer des espions et des fonctions avec un comportement pré-programmé (« stubs »).\nVous pouvez utiliser, alternativement, expect qui fait maintenant partie de Jest et expose la même API dans la documentation de Jest.\nOn va utiliser expect et le rendre globalement accessible afin de ne pas avoir à l'importer pour chaque test :\nnpm install --save-dev expect\n\nPuis dans test/setup.js:\nrequire('jsdom-global')()\n\nglobal.expect = require('expect')\n\nOptimiser Babel pour les tests\nNotez que nous utilisons babel-loader pour gérer JavaScript. Vous devriez déjà avoir Babel de configuré si vous l'utilisez dans votre application via un fichier .babelrc. Ici babel-loader va automatiquement utiliser le même fichier de configuration.\nUne autre chose à noter est que si vous utilisez une version de Node.js 6+, qui supporte déjà une majorité des fonctionnalités d'ES2015, vous pouvez configurer séparément un autre Babel env option qui va uniquement transpiler les fonctionnalités non supportées dans la version de Node.js que vous utilisez (c.-à-d. stage-2 ou le support de la syntaxe flow, etc.).\nAjouter un test\nCréez dans le dossier src un fichier nommé Counter.vue:\n\n    \n      {{ counter }}\n      Incrementer\n    \n\n\n\nexport default {\n  data () {\n    return {\n      counter: 0\n    }\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    increment () {\n      this.counter++\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nPuis créez un test nommé test/Counter.spec.js avec le code suivant :\nimport { shallow } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport Counter from '../src/Counter.vue'\n\ndescribe('Counter.vue', () => {\n  it('incrémente le compteur quand le bouton est cliqué', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Counter)\n    wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')\n    expect(wrapper.find('div').text()).toMatch('1')\n  })\n})\n\nEt maintenant on peut lancer le test avec :\nnpm run unit\nWoohoo, nos tests fonctionnent !\nRessources\n\nProjet exemple pour cette installation\nMocha\nmocha-webpack\nChai\nSinon\njest/expect\n\n"},"guides/testing-SFCs-with-karma.html":{"url":"guides/testing-SFCs-with-karma.html","title":"Testing SFCs with Karma","keywords":"","body":"Testing Single File Components with Karma\n\nAn example project for this setup is available on GitHub.\n\nKarma is a test runner that launches browsers, runs tests, and reports them back to us.

We can use the webpack config file in the base of the project without changing anything.\nIn our configuration, we run the tests in Chrome. To add extra browsers, see the Browsers section in the Karma docs.\nPicking an Assertion Library\nChai is a popular assertion library that is commonly used alongside Mocha.

More about Jest manual mocks can be found here.\nThe implementation of the axios mock looks like this:\nexport default {\n  get: () => new Promise(resolve => {\n    resolve({ data: 'value' })\n  })\n}\n\nThe below component makes an API call when a button is clicked, then assigns the response to value.\n\n  \n\n\n\n  import axios from 'axios'\n\n  export default {\n    data () {\n      return {\n        value: null\n      }\n    },\n\n    methods: {\n      async fetchResults () {\n        const response = await axios.get('mock/service')\n        this.value = response.data\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\nA test can be written like this:\nimport { shallow } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport Foo from './Foo'\njest.mock('axios')\n\ntest('Foo', () => {\n  it('fetches async when a button is clicked', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Foo)\n    wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')\n    expect(wrapper.vm.value).toBe('value')\n  })\n})\n\nThis test currently fails because the assertion is called before the promise in fetchResults resolves. Most unit test libraries provide a callback to let the runner know when the test is complete. Jest and Mocha both use done. We can use done in combination with $nextTick or setTimeout to ensure any promises resolve before the assertion is made. \ntest('Foo', () => {\n  it('fetches async when a button is clicked', (done) => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Foo)\n    wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')\n    wrapper.vm.$nextTick(() => {\n      expect(wrapper.vm.value).toBe('value')\n      done()\n    })\n  })\n})\n\nThe reason $nextTick or setTimeout allow the test to pass is because the microtask queue where promise callbacks are processed run before the task queue, where $nextTick and setTimeout are processed. This means by the time the $nexTick and setTimeout run, any promise callbacks on the microtask queue will have been executed. See here for a more detailed explanation.\nAnother solution is to use an async function and the npm package flush-promises. flush-promises flushes all pending resolved promise handlers. You can await the call of flushPromises to flush pending promises and improve the readability of your test.\nThe updated test looks like this:\nimport { shallow } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport flushPromises from 'flush-promises'\nimport Foo from './Foo'\njest.mock('axios')\n\ntest('Foo', () => {\n  it('fetches async when a button is clicked', async () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Foo)\n    wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')\n    await flushPromises()\n    expect(wrapper.vm.value).toBe('value')\n  })\n})\n\nThis same technique can be applied to Vuex actions, which return a promise by default.\n"},"guides/using-with-vue-router.html":{"url":"guides/using-with-vue-router.html","title":"Utiliser avec Vue Router","keywords":"","body":"Utilisation avec Vue Router\nInstaller Vue Router pour nos tests\nVous ne devez jamais installer Vue Router sur le constructeur de base de Vue pour vos tests.

Il fait appel à des actions Vuex.\n\n  \n    \n    Click\n  \n\n\n\nimport { mapActions } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n  methods: {\n    ...mapActions([\n      'actionClick'\n    ]),\n    actionInputIfTrue: function actionInputIfTrue (event) {\n      const inputValue = event.target.value\n      if (inputValue === 'input') {\n        this.$store.dispatch('actionInput', { inputValue })\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nPour les objectifs de ce test, on se fiche de ce que les actions font, ou à ce quoi le store ressemble. On doit juste savoir si ces actions sont lancées lorsqu'elles sont supposées l'être, et ce, avec les valeurs attendues.\nPour tester cela, on doit passer un store fictif à Vue lorsque l'on isole notre composant.\nAu lieu de passer le store au constructeur de base de Vue, on peut le passer à - localVue. Un localVue est un constructeur à portée limitée de Vue sur lequel on peut effectuer des changements sans avoir à affecter le constructeur global.\nVoyons à quoi cela ressemble :\nimport { shallow, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport Actions from '../../../src/components/Actions'\n\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\n\nlocalVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Actions.vue', () => {\n  let actions\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    actions = {\n      actionClick: jest.fn(),\n      actionInput: jest.fn()\n    }\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      state: {},\n      actions\n    })\n  })\n\n  it(\"appelle l'action `actionInput` du store quand la valeur du champ est `input` et qu'un évènement `input` est lancé\", () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    const input = wrapper.find('input')\n    input.element.value = 'input'\n    input.trigger('input')\n    expect(actions.actionInput).toHaveBeenCalled()\n  })\n\n  it(\"n'appelle pas l'action `actionInput` du store quand la valeur du champ n'est pas `input` et qu'un évènement `input` est lancé\", () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    const input = wrapper.find('input')\n    input.element.value = 'not input'\n    input.trigger('input')\n    expect(actions.actionInput).not.toHaveBeenCalled()\n  })\n\n  it(\"appelle l'action `actionClick` quand le bouton est cliqué\", () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')\n    expect(actions.actionClick).toHaveBeenCalled()\n  })\n})\n\nQue se passe-t-il ici ? Premièrement, on indique à Vue d'utiliser Vuex avec la méthode localVue.use. C'est tout simplement une surcouche de Vue.use.\nOn va ensuite créer un store fictif en appelant new Vuex.Store avec nos propres valeurs. À noter que l'on indique uniquement nos actions, car on ne s'intéresse qu'à elles.\nLes actions sont des fonctions de simulations de Jest. Ces fonctions nous donnent accès à des méthodes afin de réaliser des assertions si l'action a été appelée ou non.\nOn peut ensuite s'assurer dans nos tests que les actions ont été appelées au bon moment.\nLa manière dont on définit le store peut vous paraitre un peu étrange.\nOn utilise beforeEach pour s'assurer que nous avons un store propre avant chaque test. beforeEach est un hook de Mocha qui est appelé avant chaque test. Dans nos tests, on réassigne des valeurs aux variables du store. Si on ne le fait pas, les fonctions de simulations auraient besoin d'être automatiquement réinitialisées. Cela nous laisse la possibilité de changer l'état dans nos tests, sans avoir à affecter les prochains.\nLa chose la plus importante à noter dans ce test est que l'on crée une simulation d'un store Vuex, qui est ensuite passé à vue-test-utils.\nGénial, on peut désormais simuler des actions. Allons avoir comment simuler des accesseurs !\nSimuler des accesseurs\n\n  \n    {{inputValue}}\n    {{clicks}}\n  \n\n\n\nimport { mapGetters } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n  computed: mapGetters([\n    'clicks',\n    'inputValue'\n  ])\n}\n\n\nC'est un composant relativement simple. Il affiche le résultat des accesseurs clicks et inputValue. Encore une fois, on se fiche de savoir ce que ces accesseurs retournent. On souhaite juste savoir si les résultats sont affichés correctement.\nJetons un œil à un test :\nimport { shallow, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport Actions from '../../../src/components/Getters'\n\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\n\nlocalVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Getters.vue', () => {\n  let getters\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    getters = {\n      clicks: () => 2,\n      inputValue: () => 'input'\n    }\n\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      getters\n    })\n  })\n\n  it('affiche `state.inputValue` dans la première balise ', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    const p = wrapper.find('p')\n    expect(p.text()).toBe(getters.inputValue())\n  })\n\n  it('affiche `stat.clicks` dans la seconde balise ', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    const p = wrapper.findAll('p').at(1)\n    expect(p.text()).toBe(getters.clicks().toString())\n  })\n})\n\nCe test est similaire à notre test sur les actions. On créer un store fictif avant chaque test, on le passe ensuite comme une option lorsque l'on appelle shallow. Pour finir, on asserte que la valeur retournée par nos accesseurs fictifs est bien affichée.\nC'est génial, mais comment faisons-nous pour vérifier que nos accesseurs retournent correctement les parties de l'état ?\nSimulation avec des modules\nLes modules sont utiles pour séparer un store en plusieurs morceaux. Ils exportent des accesseurs que l'on peut utiliser dans nos tests.\nJetons un œil à ce composant :\n\n  \n    Cliquer\n    {{moduleClicks}}\n  \n\n\n\nimport { mapActions, mapGetters } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n  methods: {\n    ...mapActions([\n      'moduleActionClick'\n    ])\n  },\n\n  computed: mapGetters([\n    'moduleClicks'\n  ])\n}\n\n\nSimple composant qui possède une action et un accesseur.\nEt le test :\nimport { shallow, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport Modules from '../../../src/components/Modules'\nimport module from '../../../src/store/module'\n\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\n\nlocalVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Modules.vue', () => {\n  let actions\n  let state\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    state = {\n      module: {\n        clicks: 2\n      }\n    }\n\n    actions = {\n      moduleActionClick: jest.fn()\n    }\n\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      state,\n      actions,\n      getters: module.getters\n    })\n  })\n\n  it(\"appelle l'action du store moduleActionClick quand le bouton est cliqué\", () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Modules, { store, localVue })\n    const button = wrapper.find('button')\n    button.trigger('click')\n    expect(actions.moduleActionClick).toHaveBeenCalled()\n  })\n\n  it('affiche `state.inputValue` dans la première balise ', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Modules, { store, localVue })\n    const p = wrapper.find('p')\n    expect(p.text()).toBe(state.module.clicks.toString())\n  })\n})\n\nRessources\n\nProjet exemple pour ce guide\nlocalVue\ncreateLocalVue\n\n"},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"API","keywords":"","body":"API\n\nmount (EN)\nshallow (EN)\nMounting Options (EN)\ncontext (EN)\nslots (EN)\nstubs (EN)\nmocks (EN)\nlocalVue (EN)\nattachToDocument (EN)\nattrs (EN)\nlisteners (EN)\n\n\nWrapper (EN)\ncontains (EN)\nemitted (EN)\nemittedByOrder (EN)\nexists (EN)\ndestroy (EN)\nfind (EN)\nfindAll (EN)\nhasAttribute (EN)\nhasClass (EN)\nhasProp (EN)\nhtml (EN)\nis (EN)\nisEmpty (EN)\nisVueInstance (EN)\nname (EN)\nsetComputed (EN)\nsetData (EN)\nsetMethods (EN)\nsetProps (EN)\ntext (EN)\ntrigger (EN)\n\n\nWrapperArray (EN)\nat (EN)\ncontains (EN)\nexists (EN)\ndestroy (EN)\nhasAttribute (EN)\nhasClass (EN)\nhasProp (EN)\nis (EN)\nisEmpty (EN)\nisVueInstance (EN)\nsetComputed (EN)\nsetData (EN)\nsetMethods (EN)\nsetProps (EN)\ntrigger (EN)\n\n\ncomponents (EN)\nTransitionStub (EN)\nTransitionGroupStub (EN)\n\n\nSelectors (EN)\ncreateLocalVue (EN)\nconfig (EN)\n\n"},"api/mount.html":{"url":"api/mount.html","title":"mount","keywords":"","body":"mount(component {, options}])\n\nArguments:\n\n{Component} component\n{Object} options\n\n\nReturns: {Wrapper}\n\nOptions:\n\n\n⚠Cette page est actuellement en cours de traduction française.
